### 0.17.1

This release requires a server update to 0.17.1.

This release fixes scrolling in WebViews.

* [Updating your Calabash iOS version.](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/wiki/B1-Updating-your-Calabash-iOS-version)

It also requires at least run-loop 2.0.3.

* [Updating your run-loop version.](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/wiki/Updating-your-run-loop-version)

Calabash iOS now requires ruby >= 2.0.

### Fixes

* Scrolling on WebViews is fixed (broken in 0.17.0)
* `console_attach` works for _all strategies_; the strategy that is
  in-use will automatically be detected
* usage tracker identifies GitLab as CI
* run-loop identifies GitLab as CI when choosing timeouts
* Touching the delete keyboard on iOS 9 has been fixed

Thanks @MikeNicholls for the delete keyboard fix.

Thanks @ark-konopacki for various fixes and improvements.

### Announcements

If you are not already using bundler and Gemfile, we strongly recommend that
you start.

We have rolled out a new tool for people who are just getting started with ruby and Calabash on MacOS: [the calabash-sandbox](https://github.com/calabash/install).

If you are installing gems with sudo, we strongly recommend that you install
a [managed ruby](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/wiki/Ruby-on-MacOS#ruby-managers-on-macos) or use the calabash-sandbox.

#### Docs and Examples

For this release, we've updated the README and many of the wiki pages.  At the moment the wiki is _publicly editiable_.  If you see a typo or a way to improve the docs, please make the change.  If the change is significant, create an issue and we can discuss.

We have also updated the following repositories:

* [LPSimpleExample](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios-example)
  - compiles - thanks to everyone who reported
  - has getting started instructions
* [iOS Smoke Test App](https://github.com/calabash/ios-smoke-test-app)
  - nearly 100% coverage of all the Calabash iOS gestures and behaviors
  - examples of how manage the app life cycle and reset the keychain
  - scripts that demonstrate an efficient Calabash workflow, including how to stage binaries from Xcode builds and how to submit to the Xamarin Test Cloud.
* [iOS WebView App](https://github.com/calabash/ios-webview-test-app)

#### :preferences

In Xcode 7, Apple once again changed/broke the UIAutomation Preferences API.  We've updated the server so the :preferences strategy is available again.  The great news is that :preferences now works on _physical devices_ on iOS >= 9.0!  For now, we are keeping the default strategy as :host.  You can opt in to :preferences by:

```ruby

# Cucumber hook
options = {
  :uia_strategy => :preferences
}

launcher.relaunch(options)

# Console
> start_test_server_in_background({:uia_strategy => :preferences})
```

As we get feedback about :preferences, we'll change the defaults.

Xamarin Test Cloud users:  :preferences is now available for you!

### Calabash 2.0

Calabash 2.0 is in pre-release.

Please report issues with Calabash 2.0 as a GitHub issue or on Stack Overflow.

We are looking for help from the community to finish implementing Calabash 2.0.
You can see what has to be done in the project [GitHub issues](https://github.com/calabash/calabash/issues).

**Xamarin Test Cloud users:** Calabash 2.0 is not yet supported on Test Cloud.
Test Cloud support will be available _before_ Calabash 2.0 is released.
