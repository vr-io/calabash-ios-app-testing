### 0.19.1

Requirements:

* Calabash iOS server == 0.19.1
* run\_loop >= 2.1.2
* Ruby >= 2.0; latest released ruby is preferred.

These two wiki pages have instructions for updating the most recent versions.

* [Updating your Calabash iOS version.](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/wiki/B1-Updating-your-Calabash-iOS-version)
* [Updating your run-loop version.](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/wiki/Updating-your-run-loop-version)

### Changes

* UIA: automatically attach in the IRB #1102
* Podspec path to server should be "Calabash" not "calabash" #1098
  @ark-konopacki @tachtevrenidis
* Add nodeType to tree #1088 @TeresaP
* Fix undefined method "embed" in Calabash::Cucumber.map #1086
* IRB: save pry history to local file #1082

The 0.19.0 release notes are duplicated here.

### 0.19.0

This is a significant release. We have dropped many legacy APIs and behaviors
to make space for our new DeviceAgent tool; our replacement for UIAutomation.
This release of Calabash does not contain an interface to DeviceAgent, but if
you look at commit history of run\_loop, you will see that work have already started
integrating DeviceAgent with Calabash.

These two wiki pages have instructions for updating the most recent versions.

* [Updating your Calabash iOS version.](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/wiki/B1-Updating-your-Calabash-iOS-version)
* [Updating your run-loop version.](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/wiki/Updating-your-run-loop-version)

### Sudo

Please do not install gems with sudo.

If you are just getting started with Ruby and Calabash on MacOS, we have a new
tool: [the calabash-sandbox](https://github.com/calabash/install).

For advanced users, we recommend a [managed ruby](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/wiki/Ruby-on-MacOS#ruby-managers-on-macos).

If you are not already using bundler and Gemfile, we strongly recommend
that you start.

### IMPORTANT

The WebiView marked API [1] has been removed; see this issue [2] for more details.

The `done` method has been removed [3] from the public API because it conflicts
with Cucumber 2.1 `done`.

The `tap` method has been removed from the public API.  It has been deprecated
since 0.10.0.  Use `touch`.  Thank you for everyone who reported problems and
for your patience.

The `map` method has been replaced with `Calabash::Cucumber::Map.map`. [4]

`Calabash::Cucumber::Launcher` has been rewritten. You will find many methods
have been deprecated or removed.  You might need to update your launch hooks.
In particular, you should note that `RunLoop::Core.simulator_target?`
has been deprecated.  You should use the following methods from
`Launcher` instead: [5]

```
# Call with no argument.  The `options` argument has been deprecated.
#
# It is safe to call on the Xamarin Test Cloud.
Calabash::Cucumber::Launcher#simulator_target?
Calabash::Cucumber::Launcher#device_target?
```

Calabash no longer responds to these environment variables:

* CALABASH\_NO\_DEPRECATION
* DETECT\_CONNECTED\_DEVICE
* CALABASH\_FULL\_CONSOLE\_LOGGING

These variables are being replaced:

* NO\_STOP is in the process of being deprecated; use QUIT\_APP\_AFTER\_SCENARIO
* BUNDLE\_ID and APP\_BUNDLE\_PATH are in the process of being replaced with APP.

The public documentation [6] describes what variables Calabash iOS responds to.

If you use a custom .irbrc, please take a look at the new .irbrc [7]
that ships with Calabash.

* [1] [WebView marked API](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/wiki/06-WebView-Support#deprecated-apis)
* [2] Cannot query UIWebView by accessibilityIdentifier or accessibilityLabel

* [3] KeyboardHelpers#done clobbers the Cucumber 2.1 method #done

* [4] Change Map module to class and provide class methods

### Improvements

The `calabash-ios console` was updated with methods to improve discoverability
and your workflow.

Thanks to @ark-konopacki for porting console methods from briar and
Calabash 2.0

```
$ bundle exec calabash-ios console

#########################  Useful Methods  ##########################
     ids => List all the visible accessibility ids.
  labels => List all the visible accessibility labels.
    text => List all the visible texts.
   marks => List all the visible marks.
    tree => The app's visible view hierarchy.
   flash => flash(<query>); Disco effect for views matching <query>
 verbose => Turn debug logging on.
   quiet => Turn debug logging off.
    copy => Copy console commands to clipboard.
   clear => Clear the console.

Calabash says, "Don't touch that button!"
calabash-ios 0.19.0.pre2>
```

The `DEVICE_TARGET` method can take a device name as an argument as long as it
appears in the output of `xcrun instruments -s devices`.  We recommend
device names without spaces, using only numbers and letters.

```
$ xcrun instruments -s devices
Known Devices:
stern [4AFA58C7-<snip>-04301E70E235]
denis (9.3.1) [19368<snip>d8dd0d]

$ DEVICE_TARGET=denis DEVICE_ENDPOINT=http://denis.local:37265 bundle exec cucumber
```

We are experimenting with the automatic detection of the DEVICE\_ENDPOINT.
Pull requests are welcome. [1][2]

The method `set_text` is no longer deprecated.  Enjoy responsibly.

### Docs and Examples

For this release, we've updated the README and many of the wiki pages.  At the
moment the wiki is *publicly editable.*  If you see a typo or a way to improve
the docs, please make the change.  If the change is significant, create an
issue and we can discuss.

We have also updated the following repositories:

* [LPSimpleExample](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios-example)
  - Getting starting with Calabash
* [iOS Smoke Test App](https://github.com/calabash/ios-smoke-test-app)
  - nearly 100% coverage of all the Calabash iOS gestures and behaviors
  - examples of how manage the app life cycle and reset the keychain
  - scripts that demonstrate an efficient Calabash workflow, including how to
    stage binaries from Xcode builds and how to submit to the Xamarin Test
    Cloud.
* [iOS WebView App](https://github.com/calabash/ios-webview-test-app)
  - Updated with iframe examples

### :preferences

We've discovered the :preferences is not stable enough to use on Simulators
or physical devices.  The default will remain :host.

### Calabash 2.0

Calabash 2.0 is in pre-release.

Please report issues with Calabash 2.0 as a GitHub issue or on Stack Overflow.

We are looking for help from the community to finish implementing Calabash 2.0.
You can see what has to be done in the project [GitHub issues](https://github.com/calabash/calabash/issues).

**Xamarin Test Cloud users:** Calabash 2.0 is not yet supported on Test Cloud.
Test Cloud support will be available *before* Calabash 2.0 is released.
