### 0.20.0

This release provides support for iOS 9 and iOS 10 with Xcode 8.

If you need to test iOS 8, you must have Xcode 7 installed. macOS Sierra
does not support Xcode 7, so keep that in mind when making your macOS
upgrade plans.

Apple has removed UIAutomation from Xcode 8. Our replacement for UIAutomation
is DeviceAgent. DeviceAgent is based on Apple's XCUITest framework.

Our goal for this transition is 100% backward compatibility with
UIAutomation.  We think we are close, but we need your help to discover
what is missing.  Since UIAutomation is not available, all `uia_*` calls
now raise an error when tests are run with DeviceAgent.  The text of the
error will have workarounds and examples to help you transition your
tests.  When you find something you cannot do with DeviceAgent, please
create a GitHub issue.

Please see the
[DeviceAgent](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/wiki/DeviceAgent)
on the Calabash iOS Wiki for more details.
