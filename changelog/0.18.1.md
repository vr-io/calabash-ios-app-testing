* [Updating your run-loop version.](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/wiki/Updating-your-run-loop-version)


### Fixes

* App bundle detection has been improved.  It is not clear if the changes will
  work for all users. @ark-konopacki
* `calabash-ios check` correctly detects the Calabash iOS server
* Calabash::Cucumber::Formatter is now correctly imported

Thanks @ark-konopacki for various fixes and improvements.

### Announcements

Please do not install gems with sudo.

If you are just getting started with Ruby and Calabash on MacOS, we have a new
tool: [the calabash-sandbox](https://github.com/calabash/install).

For advanced users, we recommend a [managed ruby](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/wiki/Ruby-on-MacOS#ruby-managers-on-macos).

If you are not already using bundler and Gemfile, we strongly recommend
that you start.

#### Docs and Examples

For this release, we've updated the README and many of the wiki pages.  At the
moment the wiki is _publicly editiable_.  If you see a typo or a way to improve
the docs, please make the change.  If the change is significant, create an
issue and we can discuss.

We have also updated the following repositories:

* [LPSimpleExample](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios-example)
  - Getting starting with Calabash
* [iOS Smoke Test App](https://github.com/calabash/ios-smoke-test-app)
  - nearly 100% coverage of all the Calabash iOS gestures and behaviors
  - examples of how manage the app life cycle and reset the keychain
  - scripts that demonstrate an efficient Calabash workflow, including how to
    stage binaries from Xcode builds and how to submit to the Xamarin Test
    Cloud.
* [iOS WebView App](https://github.com/calabash/ios-webview-test-app)
  - Updated with iframe examples

#### :preferences

We've discovered the :preferences is not stable enough to use on Simulators
or physical devices.  The default will remain :host.

### Calabash 2.0

Calabash 2.0 is in pre-release.

Please report issues with Calabash 2.0 as a GitHub issue or on Stack Overflow.

We are looking for help from the community to finish implementing Calabash 2.0.
You can see what has to be done in the project [GitHub issues](https://github.com/calabash/calabash/issues).
