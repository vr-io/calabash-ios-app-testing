### 0.20.5

This release adds a public API for manually managing SpringBoard alerts.
This behavior is only available when running with Xcode 8.x. See this
pull-request for API examples: [run\_loop#611](https://github.com/calabash/run_loop/pull/611).

This release does not require a server update.

* IRB: rescue LoadError on require 'irb/\*' #1294
* DeviceAgent: add public API for managing SpringBoard alerts #1292
* Fix logical inconsistency in warning emitted by
  Launcher#calabash\_no\_launch? #1275 @duboviy
* Fix typo in contributing doc #1264 @acroos
* Update Calabash.podspec #1253 @nadzeya

### 0.20.4

This release, combined with DeviceAgent 1.0.4 and run-loop 2.2.4
fixes several critical bugs related to:

1. Code signing the DeviceAgent-Runner.app for physical devices
2. Text entry and keyboard interactions
3. Dismissing SpringBoard alerts

Definining a `CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY` is no longer necessary, but is
supported if for some reason you require a specific identity for
signing.

We have identified a flaw in text entry on i386 simulators and armv7
devices.  At the moment, we have no fail-proof solution.  We recommend
that you do not test on i386 simulators or armv7 devices.

* HTTP: dismiss SpringBoard alerts before and after most LPServer calls #1245
* DeviceAgent:API: #to\_s and #inspect #1215
* Implement Automator::DeviceAgent#clear\_text #1205
* Calabash can return the type of the visible keyboard #1207

### 0.20.3

This release, combined with DeviceAgent 1.0.2, and run-loop 2.2.2,
fixes several critical bugs related to:

1. Code signing the DeviceAgent-Runner.app for physical devices
2. Text entry and keyboard interactions

0.20.0 shipped with a mistake in the `Calabash::Cucumber::DeviceAgent`
API.  That module incorrect forwarded missing methods to `Core`.  Some
users will experience failing tests if they are making calls to `Core`
methods through the `Core::device_agent` method.  You should only be
calling `Core#device_agent` if absolutely necessary.  As time goes on,
we are finding edge cases were the DeviceAgent query engine is extremely
slow to respond.

* Automator::DeviceAgent: search for any first responder for return key
  type #1204
* Automator::DeviceAgent#tap\_keyboard\_action\_key should operate on
  button only #1202 @ark-konopacki
* Keyboard: Keyboard: text from first responders should check other views
  #1199
* DeviceAgent: automator skips keyboard visible checks #1197
* Console attach for DeviceAgent + automatic console\_attach #1192
* Full screen gestures should use screen dimensions #1190
* Update the Core#scroll methods #1189
* Capture run\_loop and xcode versions in tracker #1188 @ark-konopacki
* Replace user\_id with distinct\_id #1187 @ark-konopacki
* Adds device agent implementation for pinch #1186 @jescriba
* Added polish "message of day" #1184 @ark-konopacki
* 2x-bridge: pass string to fail method (as Calabash 0.x does) #1174
  @JoeSSS
* Refactor DeviceAgent public API screenshot and fail #1170
* Gem: force httpclient 2.7.1 or higher #1165
* Core: add #ios10?

### 0.20.0

This release provides support for iOS 9 and iOS 10 with Xcode 8.

If you need to test iOS 8, you must have Xcode 7 installed. macOS Sierra
does not support Xcode 7, so keep that in mind when making your macOS
upgrade plans.

### DeviceAgent

Apple has removed UIAutomation from Xcode 8. Our replacement for UIAutomation
is DeviceAgent. DeviceAgent is based on Apple's XCUITest framework.

Our goal for this transition is 100% backward compatibility with
UIAutomation.  We think we are close, but we need your help to discover
what is missing.  Since UIAutomation is not available, all `uia_*` calls
now raise an error when tests are run with DeviceAgent.  The text of the
error will have workarounds and examples to help you transition your
tests.  When you find something you cannot do with DeviceAgent, please
create a GitHub issue.

Please see the
[DeviceAgent](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/wiki/DeviceAgent)
on the Calabash iOS Wiki for more details.

### CODE\_SIGN\_IDENTITY

Testing on physical devices now has an additional requirement:
code signing.

```
# Find the valid code signing identities
$ xcrun security find-identity -v -p codesigning
  1) 18<snip>84 "iPhone Developer: Your Name (ABCDEF1234)"
  2) 23<snip>33 "iPhone Distribution: Your Company Name (A1B2C3D4EF)"
  3) 38<snip>11 "iPhone Developer: Your Colleague (1234ABCDEF)"

# Chose an "iPhone Developer" certificate.

$ CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY="iPhone Developer: Your Name (ABCDEF1234)" \
   DEVICE_TARGET=< udid | name> \
   DEVICE_ENDPOINT=http://< ip >:37265 \
   bundle exec cucumber
```

### 0.19.2

This is a server only release.  The gem behavior has not changed.

The 0.19.2 server fixes touch coordinates for legacy applications on
iPhone 6 Plus form factors.  Legacy applications do not have the correct

display on iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus form factors.

new rules.
