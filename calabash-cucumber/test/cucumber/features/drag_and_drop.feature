Feature: Drag and Drop
In order to test the Calabash pan API
As a Calabash developer
I want to drag a view onto another view

Background: Navigate to the special tab
Given the app has launched
And I am looking at the Pan tab
And I am looking at the Drag and Drop page

Scenario: Drag the red box to the left well
When I drag the red box to the left well
Then the well should change color
And the box goes back to its original position

Scenario: Drag the blue box to the right well
When I drag the blue box to the right well
Then the well should change color
And the box goes back to its original position

Scenario: Drag the green box to the left well
When I drag the green box to the left well
Then the well should change color
And the box goes back to its original position
